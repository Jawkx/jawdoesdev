# Hi, I'm Jaw

I'm a software developer currently working at [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/). In my day job i'm mostly responsible for developing mobile application using React Native. In my downtime, I try to self learn something else. I'm currently learning [go](https://go.dev/) to try and tackle full stack development. 

## Projects

### [jawdoes.dev](#)
It's this website! It may looks simple as it's just a plain html website, but it's generated by a node js script from a bunch of markdown file. In the age where every single webpage is using bloated framework, I find it kinda cool to do stuff the old way, but still have the flexibility to update it easily using `md`.
